Assignment 12.1: Create a Maze

This experience is a basic office maze. In order to win you need to find the red door card and use it to open the red door. Once the door is open just move forward until you find the Yellow Door. Go to door to win. Hint: The red card is near boxes.

I found the development process for this experience easier and a more predictable than the AR development. However I did have some issues with the teleporting. I'm still investigating why this issue is occuring. For this experience, I decided to not use any outside assets and used probuilder to create the card asset. I created the enviornment based on a maze I created in illustrator. Lastly I found this playlist on youtube most helpful along with the lectures. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM0k2n7u8sc&list=PLpEoiloH-4eP-OKItF8XNJ8y8e1asOJud&index=1
